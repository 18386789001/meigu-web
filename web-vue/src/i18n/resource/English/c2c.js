   "tip177": "Pending order",
   "tip178":"0 - 0.35% (Depending on the fiat currency trading pair)",
   "tip179":"*Please note that service providers for some payment methods will charge additional handling fees.",
   "tip180": "7. What is the 30-day turnover rate?",
   "tip181":"30-day completion rate = 1 - total number of orders canceled in the past 30 days / total number of orders completed in the past 30 days. Cancellation of C2C orders by buyers will affect the completion rate, while sellers' completion rate will not be affected.",
   "tip182":"If the buyer does not accept the order or complete the payment, only the buyer's closing rate will be affected.",
   "tip183": "All online transactions are protected by escrow. After the advertisement is published, the corresponding amount of cryptocurrency will be automatically reserved from the seller's fund wallet. That is to say, if the seller does not release the currency, our customer service staff can transfer the reserved The remaining cryptocurrency is paid to the buyer.",
   "tip184":"On the other hand, the seller must not release the cryptocurrency before confirming receipt of the buyer's payment. Please note that some payment methods used by the buyer do not support real-time transfer, and there may be a risk of withdrawal of the payment." ,
   "tip185": "4. Is it possible to trade without identity authentication? What needs to be done before trading on the C2C platform?",
